                            <p>Fantastic world-building, beautiful art, and a deep-voiced narrator. Bastion's not the most ambitious isometric role-playing action game, but it's so well-executed. Plus I'm a sucker for games with time loops <i>and</i> broken time loops. Supergiant being Supergiant, it has an awesome soundtrack too.</p>

                            <p>Top-notch atmosphere and world building. The powers — ranging from teleportation to possession to stopping time — are a blast to play around with, whether you're playing stealth or going on a murderous rampage. The story explores class struggle and themes of honour in the dreary city of Dunwall, a steampunk reimagining of Victorian-era London. What makes it immersive is that levels and characters respond to your actions. It's a lot more subtle and thoughful than the forced good/evil alignment in other role-playing games.</p>

It ended up being one of my favourite games in 2016 just for the really clever concept and well-executed controls. If this were a paid game, I'd gladly <i>empty</i> my wallet for it.</p>

                            <p>Years on, Mirror's Edge has become somewhat of a cult classic. People acknowledge the potential lurking beneath the flaws. I first fell in love with the game for its beautiful environments and near-future dystopian aesthetic. And after completing it, I couldn't take movement in first-person games seriously. Because traversal in Mirror's Edge feels fantastic. The camera bobs with every step, every breath, and you feel the weight of your movement. Sadly, not many games have achieved that physicality.</p>

                            <p>The flawed but enjoyable tribute to the game that first captured my heart with its striking near-future aesthetic. What I loved: combat is vastly improved with focus on momentum; Faith's moveset has been expanded for even more possibilities. What didn't work: the free-roam world only sounded nice on paper; the city, despite the stunning visuals, is bland and lifeless. What I tolerated: the story.</p>
                            <p>You know, I'm just glad we even got a sequel.</p>

                            <p>It's strange to still be playing The Sims 2 in 2016. But The Sims 4 is fundamentally broken. For all its emphasis on weirder stories, The Sims 4 falls flat in delivering gameplay with depth and sims with diverse personalities. And so, I keep going back to this childhood comfort. The modding community continues to put out amazing content, which means the game has aged gracefully.</p>
